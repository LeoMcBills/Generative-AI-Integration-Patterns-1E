## Introduction üìò

This repository delves into the integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) with various data processing tasks. It showcases different integration patterns, ranging from batch operations like metadata extraction and summarization to real-time applications such as intent classification and question-answering using retrieval-augmented generation (RAG). By leveraging the power of LLMs, this repository aims to explore innovative solutions for enhancing data processing pipelines. Whether you're interested in batch processing or real-time applications, this repository provides a comprehensive guide to integrating LLMs into your workflows.
